# CIS3319_Lab6-Kerberos
A crude simulation intended to model and perform characteristics and actions which resemble that of the Kerberos computer-network authentication protocol. Kerberos utilizes tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

Design -> Partition previous lab program into two similar subprograms; one will represent the communication between a client, C, and an authentication server, AS, while the other will represent the communication between the aforementioned client and a ticket-granting server, TGS. Afterward, create a third socket, similar to the other two, which represents the final communication between the client and a separate server, V. Note, the client component of only one communication will need to be present (persisting through the partition), as the client is not being replicated, despite the creation of numerous communications.

The design description of this project is rendered through my own writing and is therefore an original synthesis.
